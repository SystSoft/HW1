This project shows the implementation of a P-Machine, written in C programming language. A P-Machine is a stack  machine  with  one  memory area. It takes an input of instructions from the command line and outputs how the registers change. This project can be compiled using "gcc vm.c" and run it by "./a.out" with an input file with it for the command line arguement, for example "./a.out input.txt".
